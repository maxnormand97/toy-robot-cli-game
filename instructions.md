# Instruction

- write code to solve the problem below as this was production code, putting as much effort and care as you would for production code, no less, no more.

- We need instruction on how to run what you provide, but do not expect a docker image or anything related to infrastructure. For example:

  - require Ruby 3.0 or later

  - install dependencies with XXXX

  - run with “ruby my_code.rb”

# Problem

The application is a simulation of a robot moving on a 6x6 square grid.

- There are no obstructions on the grid.

- The robot needs to be prevented from exceeding the limits of the grid, but is allowed to move freely on the grid otherwise.

Create a command-line application that reads in the following commands:

- PLACE X, Y, O

- MOVE

- LEFT

- RIGHT

- REPORT

The PLACE X, Y, O will place the robot at position X, Y on the grid, with orientation O. Orientations are N, E, S, W (for North, East, South and West). Position (0,0) on the grid is the south west corner. First coordinate is along the East/West axis, the second coordinate is along the North/South axis.  
  
MOVE will move the robot one step forward, in whichever direction it is currently facing

LEFT and RIGHT respectfully turn the robot 90° angle to the left or to the right.  
  
REPORT announces the position and orientation of the robot (X, Y, O) in any format (such as standard out)

# Constraints

- Commands are to be ignored until a valid PLACE command is issued

- Any commands that would put the robot out of the defined grid is to be ignored, all other commands (including another PLACE) are to be obeyed

# Example

PLACE 0,0,E  
MOVE  
REPORT  
Output: 1,0,E

PLACE 0,0,N  
MOVE  
MOVE  
RIGHT  
MOVE  
REPORT  
Output: 1,2,E
